## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This project is built as a reusable, state-driven component.

- **React + TypeScript:** All components are built with React and strict TypeScript.
- **State Management:** The main `KanbanBoard.tsx` component acts as the "brain," managing all state logic via the `useKanbanBoard` hook. This hook handles creating, updating, and moving tasks.
- **Drag & Drop:** Implemented from scratch using the low-level hooks from `@dnd-kit/core` (`useDraggable`, `useDroppable`). [cite_start]This provides full keyboard accessibility [cite: 238] in addition to mouse/touch drag.
- **Performance:** The columns are virtualized using `react-window` and `react-virtualized-auto-sizer` to ensure high performance with 500+ tasks, as required[cite: 281].
- **Styling:** Styled with **Tailwind CSS** using the utility-first approach and the design tokens specified in the assignment[cite: 19].
